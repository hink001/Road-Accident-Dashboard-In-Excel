# Road-Accident-Dashboard-In-Excel
🚗 Road Accident Analysis Dashboard (2021–2022)
##📊 Project Overview

-This project is a Dynamic and Interactive Excel Dashboard designed to analyze road accident data from 2021–2022.
-It helps identify key trends, risk factors, and patterns in accident casualties, enabling data-driven decisions for road safety improvement.

##🎯 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

-These KPIs were used to measure accident impact and trends:
-Total Casualties – Overall number of people affected.
-Fatal Casualties – Number of deaths caused by accidents.
-Serious Casualties – Major injuries from accidents.
-Slight Casualties – Minor injury cases.
-Casualties by Vehicle Type – Cars, Bikes, Bus, Van, Agriculture vehicles, etc.
-Casualties by Road Type – Single carriageway, dual carriageway, slip roads.
-Casualties by Road Surface – Dry, wet, or icy conditions.
-Casualties by Area Location – Urban vs. Rural.
-Casualties by Light Condition – Daylight vs. Darkness.
-Monthly Trend Comparison – 2021 vs. 2022 accident pattern.

##⚙️ Tools Used
1 Microsoft Excel – For data cleaning, processing, analysis, and visualization
2 Pivot Tables – For summarizing accident data
3 Slicers & Timeline Filters – For dashboard interactivity
4 Charts & Visuals – Donut charts, Bar charts, Tree maps, and Combo charts

##🧠 Data Analysis Workflow
1 Requirement Gathering – Defined KPIs and visualization goals
2 Data Cleaning – Fixed typo errors (e.g., “fetal” → “fatal”) and ensured data accuracy
3 Data Processing – Created new columns (like Month & Year) using Excel formulas
4 Data Analysis – Aggregated accident data using Pivot Tables
5 Visualization & Dashboard Design – Created a dark-themed, interactive dashboard with slicers for filtering
